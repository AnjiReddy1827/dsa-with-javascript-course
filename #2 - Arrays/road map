ðŸ”¥ Top JavaScript Concepts for Solving Any DSA Problem
1. Master Arrays & Strings
Arrays and strings form the core of most DSA problems.

Traversal (for, while, for...of)

In-place operations (push, pop, splice, slice)

Two-pointer pattern

Sliding window

String manipulation (split, join, substring, charAt, replace, indexOf)

âœ… Example:

Reverse a string

Find longest substring without repeating characters

2. Hashing / Maps / Sets
Used for constant time lookup, deduplication, counting, and frequency mapping.

js
Copy
Edit
const map = new Map();
const set = new Set();
const obj = {};
âœ… Example:

Two Sum

Detect duplicates

Group anagrams

3. Recursion & Backtracking
Key to solving problems that require exploration like permutations, subsets, trees, etc.

js
Copy
Edit
function recurse(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;
  recurse(n - 1);
}
âœ… Example:

Fibonacci

N-Queens

Subset Sum

4. Sorting & Searching
Sort-based logic is used in almost all optimization problems.

.sort((a, b) => a - b) // Numeric sort

Binary Search (for efficient lookup in sorted arrays)

Custom sorting

âœ… Example:

K closest numbers

Median of two arrays

Merge intervals

5. Stack & Queue
Core to problems involving order, history, and sliding operations.

js
Copy
Edit
const stack = [];
stack.push(x); stack.pop();

const queue = [];
queue.push(x); queue.shift();
âœ… Example:

Valid parentheses

Next greater element

BFS traversal

6. Greedy Algorithms
Make optimal choices at each step.

âœ… Example:

Activity selection

Minimum number of platforms

Coin change (greedy variant)

7. Dynamic Programming (DP)
Solve overlapping subproblem problems by memoization or tabulation.

js
Copy
Edit
const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
dp[0] = 1;
âœ… Example:

Climbing stairs

Knapsack

Longest common subsequence

8. Graph Traversals (BFS / DFS)
Used for problems on networks, grids, and paths.

js
Copy
Edit
function dfs(node, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  visited.add(node);
  for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfs(neighbor, visited);
  }
}
âœ… Example:

Number of islands

Detect cycles

Topological sort

9. Sliding Window & Two Pointers
Used to optimize time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

âœ… Example:

Max sum subarray of size k

Longest substring without repeating characters

Trapping rainwater

10. Bit Manipulation
Powerful for low-level and optimization problems.

js
Copy
Edit
a ^ b; // XOR
a & b; // AND
a | b; // OR
a << 1; // left shift
âœ… Example:

Find the single number

Subset generation

Counting set bits

ðŸ§  Bonus: Problem Solving Techniques
Pattern recognition (sliding window, prefix sum, etc.)

Dry run the logic with examples

Think space-time tradeoffs

Break the problem down: Inputs â†’ Process â†’ Output

Use helper functions for modular code
